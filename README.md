# Elegance in Code
## UMass Darthmouth CIS600 Master's Project

# Abstract
Elegance is a more philosophical topic than those usually considered in the study of computer
science. The algorithms, languages, applications, and systems that lie at the heart of computer
science do not need to be elegant to be scalable, performant, or even correct, after all, and so
our instinct is to focus on those more concrete topics. Yet every experienced software developer
knows, both instinctively and empirically, that some software is clearly elegant and most is
definitely not.

This project attempts to better understand the nature of elegance in software and, if possible, to
build a tool to help identify it in arbitrary programs. To that end, research regarding the nature of
elegance in general, and specifically elegance in software, was first performed. The results of
that research made clear that while elegance is subjective, there is likely a relationship between
elegance and complexity. This idea drove the development of a tool for analyzing programs to
predict how elegant human evaluators would find them. Development of the tool involved
designing and deploying a survey to collect information from human evaluators about the
perceived elegance of a selected set of sample programs, generation of a variety of common
software complexity metrics for those programs, and the creation of a predictive model that
combines those two data sets to predict the elegance of other programs. Analysis of the survey
data collected and the performance of the predictive model support both the theory that
elegance is related to complexity and also the idea that tools to identify it can successfully be
built.
