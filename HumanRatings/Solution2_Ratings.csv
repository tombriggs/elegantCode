The loop should be checking for <= range so as to include the final number in the range in the calculation.  Additionally, this colution is difficult to read as the code reads as though it's checking the NEXT number in the sequence rather than the current number, and then incrementing all values before adding the sum.  While mathematically correct, it is difficult to follow the logic.

Way too many for this purpose.  No user direction despite user prompts.  Outer while loop is iterating over something with no connection to the logic checks.  Setting initial sum to 2 and skipping the first number in the sequence makes this difficult to debug/extend.  It would also be nice to group all of the variable assignments together without a cin >> in the middle."
